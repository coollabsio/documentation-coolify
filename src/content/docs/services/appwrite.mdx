## What is Appwrite?

Appwrite is an end-to-end backend server for Web, Mobile, Native, or Backend apps packaged as a set of Docker microservices. Appwrite abstracts the complexity and repetitiveness required to build a modern backend API from scratch and allows you to build secure apps faster.

Using Appwrite, you can easily integrate your app with user authentication and multiple sign-in methods, a database for storing and querying users and team data, storage and
file management, image manipulation, Cloud Functions, and [more services](https://appwrite.io/docs).
