## Cloud

The cloud option is the easiest way to get started with Coolify.

It is a paid service, where you can bring your own servers to a hosted Coolify instance.

### Benefits of the cloud option

- You do not need to take care of the maintenance of Coolify.
- You get it at the same price as if you host it for yourself.
- You get extra support.
- You get free email notifications.

## Self-hosted

You get all the features in the self-hosted version, but you need to take care of the maintenance of Coolify and all related services.

### Benefits of the self-hosted option

- No Hidden Costs. Cloud providers can become costly once you surpass the free tier. Once you go beyond the free tier, expenses can accumulate rapidly. There are plenty of <a href="https://serverlesshorrors.com" target="_blank"> horror stories</a>.
- Cost Efficient. You get way more resources for your money and you can save a lot (thousands of $) every month, like <a href="https://twitter.com/heyandras/status/1742078215986860460"  target="_blank"  > this </a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/heyandras/status/1752209429276086688" target="_blank">this</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/heyandras/status/1724510876256944244" target="_blank">this </a>
- Easier Than You Think. Servers (hardware + software) have changed a lot since cloud providers emerged. And with software (like Coolify), you can start hosting in minutes without any maintanence work.
- Data Privacy. Currently, data privacy is a major issue. By self-hosting, you have complete control over your data and can guarantee that it is not being misused.
- No Features Behind Paywall. Everything is included in the open-source software (OSS) version. And will always be.
- No Limitations. You have the freedom to host an unlimited number of websites on any quantity of servers without any restrictions.
- Nice UI. You get a simple and easy to use UI to manage your servers and applications.
- Open Source. You can see the source code and contribute to it, if you want. You can shape the future of the software.
