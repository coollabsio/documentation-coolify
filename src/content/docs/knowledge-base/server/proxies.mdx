Coolify supports `Traefik` (default) and `Caddy` (experimental) proxies.

## Switch between proxies

Since `beta.237`, we have added support for Caddy and Traefik as proxies. You can switch between them at any time.

Before you switch proxies and if you have an application that was created before `beta.237`, you need to make sure of the following:

1.  You must have `caddy_*` or `traefik_*` labels on your resources.

<Aside type="tip">
  If you don't have `caddy_*` or `traefik_*` labels: 1. Automatically: A restart
  of your resource will add the missing labels. 2. Manually: - `For
  Applications`: click on the `Reset to Coolify Default Labels` button. - `For
  Services`: simply save the service - it will automatically add required
  labels.
</Aside>

2. You need to restart your service so that the new labels will be applied.
