If you are using `Docker Compose` based deployments, you need to understand how Docker Compose works with Coolify.

In all cases the Docker Compose (`docker-compose.y[a]ml`) file is the single source of truth.

## Environment variables

To read more about environment variables, please refer to the [Environment Variables](/docs/knowledge-base/environment-variables) page.

## Storage

You can predefine storage normally in your compose file, but there are a few extra options that you can set to tell Coolify what to do with the storage.

### Create an empty directory

```yaml
# Predefine directories with host binding
services:
  filebrowser:
    image: filebrowser/filebrowser:latest
    volumes:
      - type: bind
        source: ./srv
        target: /srv
        is_directory: true # This will tell Coolify to create the directory (this is not available in a normal docker-compose)
```

### Create a file with content

Here you can see how to add a file with content and a dynamic value that is coming from an environment variable.

```yaml
services:
  filebrowser:
    image: filebrowser/filebrowser:latest
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password
    volumes:
      - type: bind
        source: ./srv/99-roles.sql
        target: /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/init-scripts/99-roles.sql
        content: |
          -- NOTE: change to your own passwords for production environments
           \set pgpass `echo "$POSTGRES_PASSWORD"`

           ALTER USER authenticator WITH PASSWORD :'pgpass';
           ALTER USER pgbouncer WITH PASSWORD :'pgpass';
```

## Exclude from healthchecks

If you have a service that you do not want to be part of your overall healthchecks, you can exclude it from the healthchecks by setting the `exclude_from_hc` option to `true`.

<Aside type="tip">
 This is useful for example if you have a migration service that runs only once and then the container stops.
</Aside>

```yaml
services:
  some-service:
    exclude_from_hc: true
    ...
```

## Connect to Predefined Networks

By default, each compose stack is deployed to a separate network, with the name of your resource uuid. This will allow to each service in your stack to communicate with each other.

But in some cases, you would like to communicate with other resources in your account. For example, you would like to connect your application to a database, which is deployed in another stack.

To do this you need to enable `Connect to Predefined Network` option on your `Service Stack` page, but this will make the internal Docker DNS not work as expected.

Here is an example. You have a stack with a `postgres` database and a `laravel` application. Coolify will rename your `postgres` stack to `postgres-<uuid>` and your `laravel` stack to `laravel-<uuid>` to prevent name collisions.

If you set `Connect to Predefined Network` option on your `laravel` stack, your `laravel` application will be able to connect to your `postgres` database, but you need to use the `postgres-<uuid>` as your database host.


## Raw Docker Compose Deployment

You can set up your project to use docker compose build pack to deploy your compose file directly without most of Coolify's magic. It is called `Raw Compose Deployment`.

<Aside type="tip">
  This is for advanced users. If you are not familiar with Docker Compose, we do
  not recommend this method.
</Aside>

### Labels

Coolify will still add the following labels (if they are not set) to your application:

```yaml
labels:
  - coolify.managed=true
  - coolify.applicationId=5
  - coolify.type=application
```

To use Coolify's Proxy (Traefik), you need to set the following labels to your application:

```yaml
labels:
  - traefik.enable=true
  - "traefik.http.routers.<unique_router_name>.rule=Host(`coolify.io`) && PathPrefix(`/`)"
  - traefik.http.routers.<unique_router_name>.entryPoints=http
```
