Coolify provides a robust notification system that supports multiple channels. You can configure notifications in the **Notifications** tab of your Coolify dashboard.

## Notification Providers

Below are guides for setting up supported notification providers in Coolify.

### Email

<Aside type="note">
Email notifications can be configured using either SMTP or [Resend](https://resend.com).
</Aside>

<Steps>
1. Navigate to **Notifications** → **Email**

2. Choose your email provider:
   - Use system-wide (transactional) email settings (if you self-host Coolify, you can set this up in the Instance Settings)
   - SMTP
   - Resend

3. Configure your chosen provider:

   #### System-Wide Email Settings
   - Enable the `Use System-Wide Email Settings` checkbox
   
   #### SMTP Configuration
    - Fill in the following fields:
      - `From Name` - Display name for the sender
      - `From Address` - Email address notifications will come from
      - `Host` - SMTP server hostname (e.g., smtp.gmail.com)
      - `Port` - SMTP port (typically 587 or 465)
      - `Username` - SMTP authentication username
      - `Password` - SMTP authentication password
      - `Encryption` - TLS, SSL, or None (not recommended as it is highly insecure)
      - `Timeout` - Connection timeout in seconds
    - Enable the `SMTP` checkbox

   #### Resend Configuration
   - Enable the `Resend` checkbox
   - Enter your `Resend API Key`

4. Click `Send Test Email` to verify your setup
</Steps>

### Telegram

<Steps>
1. Initial Setup (Phone Required)
   - Create a Telegram account using your phone number
   - Open the Telegram app on your phone
   - Go to **Settings** → **Profile**
   - Set up a username (recommended)

2. Create Your Bot (Can be done on desktop)
   - Message [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather)
   - Send the `/newbot` command
   - Follow BotFather's instructions to create your bot
   - Copy the `bot token` when displayed

    <Aside type="tip">
    Delete the message containing your bot token after saving it securely.
    </Aside>

3. Create and add your bot to a group
   - Create a new group in Telegram
   - Add your bot to the group (you can add it by using the bot name)

4. Make the bot an admin of the group
   - Click on the group name
   - Locate the members list
   - Click on the bot name
   - Click on **Add to group or channel**
   - Choose the group
   - Enable the `admin` toggle
   - Click on **Add bot as admin**

5. Enable Topics (Optional, Phone Required)
   - Open the group on your phone
   - Tap the group name
   - Tap the pencil icon (edit)
   - Find and enable **Topics** (this enables threads for the group)
   - You can now create topics using the 3-dot menu in the group (also works on desktop)

6. Get Required IDs (Can be done on desktop)
   - Visit: `https://api.telegram.org/bot{YOUR_BOT_TOKEN}/getUpdates`
   - Send a test message in your group or thread/topic
   - Find these values in the response:
     - `Chat ID`: Look for `"chat":{"id":-100XXXXXXXXX}`
     - `Thread/Topic ID` (if using threads): Look for `"message_thread_id":XXXXX`

7. Configure Coolify
   - Go to **Notifications** → **Telegram**
   - Enter your `bot token` (from step 2)
   - Enter the `chat ID` (include the `-` minus sign if present)
   - Enter the `thread/topic ID` (only if using threads)
   - Save settings
   - Enable the Telegram channel
   - Send a `Test notification`
</Steps>

<Aside type="caution">
Common issues:
- Make sure the bot is an admin in the group/channel
- Include the minus sign (-) in the chat ID if present
- For groups/channels, the chat ID usually starts with `-100`
- If `getUpdates` returns an empty response, send another message and try again
</Aside>

<Aside type="tip" title="Thread/Topic ID">
If you are not using threads, you can leave the thread/topic ID empty in Coolify.
