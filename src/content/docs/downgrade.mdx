If you have any issues with the latest version, you can simply downgrade to the previous version. Here is how you can do it:

<Steps>
 1. **Disable Auto Update**
    - Login as the `root` user (or any user that is in the `root` (initial) team),
    go to your `Settings` menu and disable the `Auto Update` feature.

 2. **Login to your server via SSH**
    - Login to your server via SSH and execute the following command:
    ```bash
      curl -fsSL https://cdn.coollabs.io/coolify/install.sh | bash -s 4.0.0-beta.277
    ```

    Where `4.0.0-beta.277` is the version you want to downgrade to.

</Steps>

  Please note that downgrading could cause weird issues, as the database schema
  is not backward compatible. Some features might not work as expected.
