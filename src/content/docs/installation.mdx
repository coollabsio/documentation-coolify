  Quick Installation (recommended):
  ```bash 
  curl -fsSL https://cdn.coollabs.io/coolify/install.sh | bash 
  ```
  For detailed setup instructions, including firewall configuration and prerequisites, see the [Quick Installation Guide](#1-quick-installation-recommended) below.
</Aside>

## Prerequisites

### Server Requirements
You need a server with SSH access. This can be:
- A VPS
- A Dedicated Server 
- A VM in Proxmox
- A Raspberry Pi (for all compatible models read the [Raspberry Pi OS Setup Guide](/docs/knowledge-base/how-to/raspberry-pi-os#prerequisites) prerequisites)
- Any other server with SSH access

<Aside>
  It is strongly recommended to use a fresh, newly created server for installing Coolify. Installing on an existing server with other applications may lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior.
</Aside>

<Aside type="tip">
  If you don't have a server or server provider yet, we prefer to use Hetzner.

  You can use our [referral link](https://coolify.io/hetzner). It will help us to keep the project alive.
</Aside>


### Supported Operating Systems

- Debian based Linux distributions (Debian, Ubuntu, etc.)
- Redhat based Linux distributions (CentOS, Fedora, Redhat, AlmaLinux, Rocky, Asahi, etc.)
- SUSE based Linux distributions (SLES, SUSE, openSUSE, etc.)
- Arch Linux
- Raspberry Pi OS 64-bit (Raspbian)
- Alpine Linux


### Supported Architectures
We only support 64-bit architectures:
- AMD64
- ARM64

<Aside type="caution">
For Raspberry Pi users: You must use the 64-bit version of Raspberry Pi OS (Raspbian). See our [Raspberry Pi OS Setup Guide](/docs/knowledge-base/how-to/raspberry-pi-os) for instructions.
</Aside>

### Minimum Hardware Requirements

#### Server Requirements for Coolify
- 2 Core CPU
- 2 GBs memory (RAM)
- 30+ GB of storage for the images

If you build and host on the same server as Coolify and your builds are utilizing all available memory, this may cause the server to become unresponsive or even crash. 
To prevent this, consider enabling swap space on your server (or paying for more resources).

#### Server Requirements for Your Resources
Choosing your server resources depends on your usage. If you are planning to run a lot of things, you should consider buying a server with more resources.

Hosting `Supabase`, `Appwrite` or `Posthog` requires more resources than hosting a static site (waay more).

<Aside type="tip">

Here is an example. I'm hosting most of my production stuffs on a server with:

```
- 8GB of memory (average usage 3.5GB)
- 4 CPUs (average usage ~20-30%)
- 150GB disk (usage 40GB)
```

For the following things:

```
- 3 NodeJS apps
- 4 Static sites
- Plausible Analytics (for visitor analytics)
- Fider (feedback tool)
- UptimeKuma (uptime monitoring)
- Ghost (my newsletters)
- 3 Redis databases
- 2 PostgreSQL databases
```

</Aside>


## Installation Methods

### 1. Quick Installation (Recommended)

<Steps>
1. Verify Prerequisites
   - The `curl` command is installed on your server (this will most likely be the case)
   - Your firewall is configured with the required ports ([setup guide](/docs/knowledge-base/server/firewall)) (if you are and advanced user you can have this configured differently)

2. Run the installation script

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://cdn.coollabs.io/coolify/install.sh | bash
   ```
   > View the [Scripts Source Code](https://github.com/coollabsio/coolify/blob/main/scripts/install.sh)

3. Access coolify
    - You can find the URL of your coolify instance in the installation output.
    - It is recommended to use the PrivateIP to access coolify as it is more secure (a VPN setup to your Server is needed for that to work).

    <Aside type="note">
    If you installed coolify on a Raspberry Pi which is in your home network you can use the private IP address to access coolify as the public IP address will not work.
    </Aside>

</Steps>

**The installer does the following:**
- Installs required tools (`curl wget git jq`)
- Installs Docker Engine (26+)

<Aside type="caution">
Docker engine installed via snap is not supported!
</Aside>

- Configures Docker logging
- Configures Docker daemon with default address pools
- Creates directory structure at `/data/coolify`
- Sets up SSH keys for server management
- Installs and starts Coolify

### 2. Manual Installation
For users who prefer more control over the installation process.

<Steps>
1. SSH Enabled
    Make sure SSH is enabled and you can connect to your server with SSH from your local machine with root user: [more details here](/docs/knowledge-base/server/openssh).

2. Curl Installed
    Make sure `curl` command is available on your server.

3. Install Docker Engine (24+)
    Follow the official documentation to install Docker Engine on your server: [Docker Engine Installation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/#server).
    
    <Aside type="caution">
    Make sure to not install docker engine via snap as this is not supported!
    </Aside>

4. Create Directories
    Create the base configuration directories under `/data/coolify`.

    ```bash
    mkdir -p /data/coolify/{source,ssh,applications,databases,backups,services,proxy,webhooks-during-maintenance}
    mkdir -p /data/coolify/ssh/{keys,mux}
    mkdir -p /data/coolify/proxy/dynamic
    ```

5. Generate SSH Key
    Generate an SSH key for Coolify to be able to manage this server from itself.

    ```bash

    ssh-keygen -f /data/coolify/ssh/keys/id.root@host.docker.internal -t ed25519 -N '' -C root@coolify
    ```

6. Setup Your SSH Key
    Add your public SSH key to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`. This will allow Coolify to connect to this server from itself.

    ```bash
    cat /data/coolify/ssh/keys/id.root@host.docker.internal.pub >>~/.ssh/authorized_keys
    chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
    ```
    <Aside type="tip">
    You can skip this step if you already have an SSH key. But you need to add this key to your Coolify instance after installation.
    </Aside>

7. Setup Configuration Files
    Copy the `docker-compose.yml`, `docker-compose.prod.yml`, `.env.production` & `upgrade.sh` files from Coolify's CDN to `/data/coolify/source`.

    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://cdn.coollabs.io/coolify/docker-compose.yml -o /data/coolify/source/docker-compose.yml
    curl -fsSL https://cdn.coollabs.io/coolify/docker-compose.prod.yml -o /data/coolify/source/docker-compose.prod.yml
    curl -fsSL https://cdn.coollabs.io/coolify/.env.production -o /data/coolify/source/.env
    curl -fsSL https://cdn.coollabs.io/coolify/upgrade.sh -o /data/coolify/source/upgrade.sh
    ```

8. Set Permissions
   Set permissions for all the files and directories.
    ```bash
    chown -R 9999:root /data/coolify
    chmod -R 700 /data/coolify
    ```

9. Generate Values
    Generate values for the following variables in `/data/coolify/source/.env`.
    ```bash
    sed -i "s|APP_ID=.*|APP_ID=$(openssl rand -hex 16)|g" /data/coolify/source/.env
    sed -i "s|APP_KEY=.*|APP_KEY=base64:$(openssl rand -base64 32)|g" /data/coolify/source/.env
    sed -i "s|DB_PASSWORD=.*|DB_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -base64 32)|g" /data/coolify/source/.env
    sed -i "s|REDIS_PASSWORD=.*|REDIS_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -base64 32)|g" /data/coolify/source/.env
    sed -i "s|PUSHER_APP_ID=.*|PUSHER_APP_ID=$(openssl rand -hex 32)|g" /data/coolify/source/.env
    sed -i "s|PUSHER_APP_KEY=.*|PUSHER_APP_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32)|g" /data/coolify/source/.env
    sed -i "s|PUSHER_APP_SECRET=.*|PUSHER_APP_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32)|g" /data/coolify/source/.env
    ```
    <Aside type="caution">
    This only needs to be done once, when you install Coolify for the first time. If you do it after Coolify has been first started, it will break your installation.

    Make sure you save the values somewhere that are stored in the `.env` file. If you lose them, you will lose access to your Coolify installation and all your data.
    </Aside>

10. Default Docker Network
    Make sure the default `coolify` Docker network is available.
    ```bash
    docker network create --attachable coolify
    ```

11. Start Coolify
    ```bash
    docker compose --env-file /data/coolify/source/.env -f /data/coolify/source/docker-compose.yml -f /data/coolify/source/docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --pull always --remove-orphans --force-recreate
    ```

12. Open Coolify's UI
    Now you can access Coolify on port `http://<ip>:8000` of your server.

</Steps>

### 3. Docker Desktop Installation
For local development and testing purposes only.

<Aside type="caution">
  This is not recommended for production usage. This is only for testing
  purposes.
</Aside>

- Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) for Windows.
- Create a directory that will hold all your Coolify related data. For example in your User directory: `C:\Users\yourusername\coolify`.
- Copy `docker-compose.windows.yml` and `.env.windows-docker-desktop.example` to the directory you created in the previous step.
- Rename `docker-compose.windows.yml` to `docker-compose.yml`.
- Rename `.env.windows-docker-desktop.example` to `.env`.
- Create a `coolify` docker network with `docker network create coolify`.
- Optional: Change the values in `.env` file.
- Start Coolify with `docker compose up` command.
- You can access Coolify on port `localhost:8000` of your machine.


<Aside type="caution">
Coolify Proxy is still not working on Windows.
</Aside>


## Debugging

### Expired GitHub Personal Access Token
If you encounter an error like `Error response from daemon: Head "https://ghcr.io/v2/coollabsio/coolify-helper/manifests/1.0.1": unauthorized: authentication required`, it means Docker cannot access the GitHub Container Registry.

To fix this, either:
- Log out of the GitHub Container Registry or
- Renew your GitHub Personal Access Token

### Raspberry Pi Crashes
If you are using a Raspberry Pi with only 2GB of RAM, you may experience system crashes even with swap space enabled. This probably occurs because Raspberry PIs often use SD cards which are slower than SSDs and can be unstable.

The solution is to either:
- Upgrade to a modern Raspberry Pi with 4GB+ of RAM, or
- Limit Docker's memory usage by adding the following to your `/etc/docker/daemon.json` file:

```json
{
  "memory": "1.8g"
}
```
