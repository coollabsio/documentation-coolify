## What is DragonFly

DragonFly is a modern in-memory datastore, designed as a Redis alternative with better scalability and resource efficiency. It offers a Redis-compatible API while providing improved performance on multi-core systems. DragonFly is built to handle high-throughput scenarios and large datasets more efficiently than traditional in-memory datastores.

With its multi-threaded architecture and advanced data structures, DragonFly aims to provide enhanced scalability and performance for applications that require Redis-like functionality on modern hardware.

## Data Persistence
By default, Dragonfly DB does not save data to disk. To enable persistence, set up snapshots manually. 

For example, configure the service with:

 ```yaml
services:
  dragonfly:
    command: 'dragonfly --requirepass XXXXXXXX --dir /data --dbfilename dragonfly-snapshot-{timestamp} --snapshot_cron "*/5 * * * *"'
 ```

You can also trigger manual saves using the SDK's `SAVE` command.
