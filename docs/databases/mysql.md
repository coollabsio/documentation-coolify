## What is MySQL

MySQL is a widely-used, open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) known for its reliability, ease of use, and performance. It's an essential component of the popular LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP/Python/Perl) stack used for web development.

MySQL provides a robust, ACID-compliant database solution suitable for a wide range of applications, from small websites to large-scale enterprise systems. It offers features like replication, partitioning, and full-text indexing, making it versatile for various use cases.
