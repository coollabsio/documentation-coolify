## What is Metabase?

Metabase is the easy, open-source way for everyone in your company to ask questions and learn from data.

## Features

- [Set up in five minutes](https://www.metabase.com/docs/latest/setting-up-metabase.html) (we're not kidding).
- Let anyone on your team [ask questions](https://www.metabase.com/docs/latest/users-guide/04-asking-questions.html) without knowing SQL.
- Use the [SQL editor](https://www.metabase.com/docs/latest/questions/native-editor/writing-sql) for more complex queries.
- Build handsome, interactive [dashboards](https://www.metabase.com/docs/latest/users-guide/07-dashboards.html) with filters, auto-refresh, fullscreen, and custom click behavior.
- Create [models](https://www.metabase.com/learn/getting-started/models) that clean up, annotate, and/or combine raw tables.
- Define canonical [segments and metrics](https://www.metabase.com/docs/latest/administration-guide/07-segments-and-metrics.html) for your team to use.
- Send data to Slack or email on a schedule with [dashboard subscriptions](https://www.metabase.com/docs/latest/users-guide/dashboard-subscriptions).
- Set up [alerts](https://www.metabase.com/docs/latest/users-guide/15-alerts.html) to have Metabase notify you when your data changes.
- [Embed charts and dashboards](https://www.metabase.com/docs/latest/administration-guide/13-embedding.html) in your app, or even [your entire Metabase](https://www.metabase.com/docs/latest/enterprise-guide/full-app-embedding.html).
