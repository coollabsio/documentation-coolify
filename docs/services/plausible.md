## What is Plausible Analytics?

Plausible is intuitive, lightweight and open-source web analytics software. It uses no cookies and is fully compliant with GDPR, CCPA and PECR.

## How to deploy Plausible Analytics with Coolify?

Due to trademark issues, we can't provide a fully automated one-click Service installation for Plausible Analytics. But don't worry, it's still very easy to install.

## Installation

1. Add a New Resource and select the `Docker Compose Empty` application deployment type.
2. Copy the following [file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coollabsio/coolify/main/templates/compose/plausible.yaml) into the input box (with the comments).
3. Click on the `Save` button.
4. Go to the `Plausible` service's settings page (`Settings` button on the right side).
5. Add your custom domain to the `Domains` input box (you can also edit the domains by clicking on the edit icon next to the autogenerated domain).
6. Click on the `Save` button.
7. Click on the `Deploy` button and wait for the deployment to finish.
