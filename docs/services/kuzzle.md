## What is Kuzzle?

Kuzzle is a generic backend offering the basic building blocks common to every application.

Rather than developing the same standard features over and over again each time you create a new application, Kuzzle proposes them off the shelf, allowing you to focus on building high-level, high-value business functionalities.

## Features

Kuzzle enables you to build modern web applications and complex IoT networks in no time.

- API First: use a standardised multi-protocol API.
- Persisted Data: store your data and perform advanced searches on it.
- Realtime Notifications: use the pub/sub system or subscribe to database notifications.
- User Management: login, logout and security rules are no more a burden.
- Extensible: develop advanced business feature directly with the integrated framework.
- Client SDKs: use our SDKs to accelerate the frontend development.
