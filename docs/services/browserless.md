## What is Browserless
Browserless is a platform that provides headless browser automation and management services. It allows developers to run automated browser tasks without the need for manual intervention, making it ideal for web scraping, testing, and rendering tasks.


## Example use cases
- Web Scraping: Automate the collection of data from websites, such as product prices, news articles, or social media content, without worrying about CAPTCHAs, JavaScript rendering, or rate limits.

- Automated Testing: Run browser-based tests for web applications using tools like Puppeteer or Selenium to check functionality, compatibility, and performance across different browsers.

- PDF Generation: Convert webpages or HTML content into PDFs automatically, which is useful for invoicing, reporting, or archiving purposes.

- Website Monitoring: Automate the monitoring of websites for uptime, broken links, or content changes, ensuring everything is functioning as expected without manually visiting the site.

- SEO Audits: Use Browserless to run scripts that crawl your website, analyzing metadata, tags, and other factors that impact SEO, ensuring your site follows best practices.


## Key Features
- Headless Browser Automation: Supports running headless browsers, automating tasks with Puppeteer, Playwright, and Selenium without manual browser operation.

- Cloud-Based Infrastructure: Run scripts in the cloud, reducing the need to manage your own browser environments and infrastructure.

- Pre-Built APIs: Offers APIs for common tasks like screenshotting, PDF generation, and web scraping, simplifying integration.

- Scalability: Easily scale automation tasks across many concurrent browser sessions.

- Logging & Debugging Tools: Detailed logging and debugging tools for tracking and troubleshooting automated browser sessions.
