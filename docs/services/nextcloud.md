## What is NextCloud?

NextCloud is an open-source productivity platform that provides a secure and private alternative to popular cloud storage services like Google Drive and Dropbox. It allows you to store, sync, and share files, photos, and videos across multiple devices, and offers features like file versioning, password-protected sharing, and collaboration tools.
