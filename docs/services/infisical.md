## What is Infisical?

Infisical is the open source security infrastructure platform that engineers use for secrets management, internal PKI, key management, and SSH workflow orchestration.

- Secrets Management: Infisical's secrets management module lets developers centralize and securely manage application configuration, API keys, database credentials, and other sensitive data.
- Public Key Infrastructure (PKI): Infisical PKI lets you operate an internal certificate authority and manage the full X.509 certificate lifecycle for services, applications, and devices.
- Key Management System (KMS): Infisical KMS helps you generate and securely manage encryption keys to encrypt/decrypt data.
- SSH Certificate Management: Infisical SSH lets you provision engineers short-lived, secure SSH access to infrastructure by replacing traditional static SSH keys with ephemeral certificate-based authentication.
