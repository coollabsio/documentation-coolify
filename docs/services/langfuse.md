# What is Langfuse?

[Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/) is an **[open-source](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse) LLM engineering platform** that empowers teams to collaboratively **debug**, **analyze**, and **iterate** on their LLM applications. 

It accelerates the development workflow by providing tools for **observability**, **tracing**, **prompt management**, **evaluation**, and **analytics**.

## Key Features

### Observability and Tracing

- **Insights**: Gain a granular understanding of your LLM's behavior with detailed tracing capabilities.
- **Integrations**: Seamlessly integrate with popular frameworks like [LangChain](https://langfuse.com/docs/integrations/langchain), [Llama Index](https://langfuse.com/docs/integrations/llama-index), and [OpenAI](https://langfuse.com/docs/integrations/openai).

### Prompt Management

- **Linked Tracing**: Connect prompt versions with tracing data for a holistic view of interactions.
- **Zero Latency**: Experience prompt management without added latency in your applications.
- **Efficient Management**: Organize and version your prompts to optimize model performance.

### Evaluation and Analytics

- **Model-Based Evaluations**: Utilize built-in tools or integrate external pipelines like [UpTrain](https://langfuse.com/guides/cookbook/evaluation_with_uptrain) and [Ragas](https://langfuse.com/guides/cookbook/evaluation_of_rag_with_ragas).
- **Custom Metrics**: Define and track custom scores and annotations to measure performance.
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Access visualizations and reports to monitor usage, costs, and model effectiveness.
