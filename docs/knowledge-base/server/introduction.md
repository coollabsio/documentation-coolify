# Introduction
No matter what type of server you have (localhost or remote), you need the following requirements.
- Connectivity
  - SSH connectivity between Coolify and the server with SSH key authentication.
     ::: success Tip
     Your public key should be added to **root** user's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`.
     If you do not have an SSH Key, you can generate one through Coolify with a simple button or you can generate one manually.
     :::
- Docker Engine (24+)
## Types
- **Localhost**: the server where Coolify is installed.
- **Remote Server**: could be any remote linux server.
## Localhost
To be able to manage the server where Coolify is running on, the docker container of Coolify should reach the host server through SSH.
You can use localhost as a server where all your resources are running, but it is not recommended as high server usage could prevent to use Coolify.
::: success Tip
  You can use our [Cloud](https://app.coolify.io) version, so you only need a server for your resources. 
  
  You will get a few other things included with the cloud version, like free email notifications, s3 storage, etc based on your subscription plan.
:::
## Remote Server
You can connect any type of servers to Coolify. It could be a VPS, a Raspberry PI or a laptop running Linux.
::: success Tip
If you don't have a server or server provider yet, we prefer to use Hetzner.
You can use our [referral link](https://coolify.io/hetzner). It will help us to keep the project alive.
:::
### Cloudflare Tunnels
You can also set to use Cloudflare Tunnels for your servers.
::: success Tip
Coolify does not install cloudflared on your server, it needs to be done prior.
All it does is to add the right ProxyCommand (`ProxyCommand <ip / hostname> access ssh --hostname %h`) to all ssh connections.

## Multiple Server Configuration
When setting up multiple servers in Coolify, it's important to understand how traffic routing works:

- **Independent Proxy Handling**: Each server runs its own proxy that handles incoming requests for applications deployed on that server.
- **Direct Traffic Flow**: Traffic for applications deployed on secondary servers goes directly to those servers, not through the main Coolify server.
- **DNS Configuration**: You must point your domain DNS to the IP address of the server where the application is deployed, not to the main Coolify server.

### Role of the Main Server
The main Coolify server:
- Provides the management UI to control applications on all connected servers
- Performs SSH connections to secondary servers for deployment and management
- Conducts health checks and monitoring
- Does NOT route or proxy traffic to applications on secondary servers

This architecture reduces latency and improves application performance by eliminating additional network hops.

## Features
### Disk Cleanup threshold
You can read more about Automated Cleanup and the disk cleanup threshold in the [Automated Cleanup](/knowledge-base/server/automated-cleanup) section.
### Wildcard Domain
You can set a wildcard domain (`example: http://example.com`) to your server, so you can easily assign generated domains to all the resources connected to this server.
Example: Your application UUID is `vgsco4o`.
If you have the example set, you will get the following FQDN: `http://vgsco4o.example.com`
If you do not have any wildcard domain set, Coolify will generate a [sslip.io](https://sslip.io) domain, which is free & magical domain that you can use anywhere.
In this case, it will be: `http://vgsco4o.127.0.0.1.sslip.io`, where `127.0.0.1` is your server's IP.

::: success Tip
When using multiple servers, remember that each application's domain must point to the specific server where that application is deployed.
:::

## Proxy
- **Traefik**: Automatically configure Traefik(v2) based on your deployed resources.
- **Custom/None**: You will configure a proxy manually (only for advanced users).
::: success Tip
  Soon we will support Nginx & Caddy with fully automated configuration.
:::
### Traefik
Coolify uses Traefik proxy by default to create a reverse proxy for your resources.
::: success Tip
  Traefik only starts when you did not select any proxy for your server and you
  have a domain configured for a resource or your Coolify instance itself.
:::
#### Dynamic Configuration
You can always add your own configuration to the proxy settings from Coolify's UI (`/server/<server_uuid>/proxy`).
