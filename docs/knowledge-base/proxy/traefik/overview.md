# Traefik Proxy
[Traefik ↗](https://traefik.io/) is a modern, open-source reverse proxy and load balancer designed to handle incoming requests and route them to the appropriate services. It’s widely used in the container ecosystem, making it a perfect fit for projects running on Coolify.  

By default, Coolify uses Traefik as its proxy, enabling easy management of routing, SSL certificates, and more, without requiring deep technical expertise.  


## Why Use Traefik?  
- Dynamically manages routing between your apps and the internet.  
- Integrates seamlessly with container orchestrators like Docker or Kubernetes.  
- Simplifies SSL/TLS certificate management, including support for [Let's Encrypt ↗](https://letsencrypt.org/).  
- Offers advanced features like load balancing and middleware for fine-grained control.  
- Comes with a built-in dashboard for monitoring routes and configurations.  


## When Not to Use Traefik?  
- If you need complete control over every aspect of your reverse proxy.  
- If you prefer using another reverse proxy solution like [NGINX ↗](https://nginx.org/en/).  
- If you have highly customized or complex routing rules that Traefik might not fully support.  


## Ways to Use Traefik with Coolify
