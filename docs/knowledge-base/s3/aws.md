<ZoomableImage src="/docs/images/aws-s3/header.webp" />

Coolify offers automated backups of your instance to an AWS S3 bucket, giving you a hands‑off, reliable way to safeguard your configuration and data.

### Why use AWS S3 with Coolify?  
1. **Enterprise‑grade durability & availability:** S3 is designed for 99.999999999% durability and automatic replication across multiple facilities, so your backups are always safe and accessible.  

2. **Cost‑effective, pay as you go pricing:** Only pay for the storage and requests you actually use, with built‑in lifecycle rules (e.g., transition to Glacier) to optimize long‑term costs.  

3. **Seamless integration** – Coolify’s backup scheduler hooks directly into S3’s API, eliminating the need for custom scripts or third‑party tools and ensuring backups run on a schedule.  


### When to avoid using AWS S3 with Coolify?  
1. **Strict data residency or on‑prem requirements:** If your regulations mandate keeping backups entirely within a private data center, S3’s public cloud model may not comply.  

2. **No external network access:** In environments where outbound internet is blocked, Coolify cannot push snapshots to an S3 endpoint.

1. Create a bucket in AWS Console
2. Create a custom policy in AWS Console with the following permissions:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:ListBucket",
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:DeleteObject",
        "s3:GetObjectAcl",
        "s3:PutObjectAcl",
        "s3:PutObject"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        // rewrite your-bucket-name with your bucket name
        "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name",
        "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

3. Create an IAM user in AWS Console & attach the policy from the previous step.
4. Go to User settings & create an `Access Key` in AWS Console.
5. Add the `Access Key` and `Secret Key` in Coolify when you create a new S3 source.
   ::: success Tip
     You need to use the S3 HTTP endpoint without the bucket name, for example,`https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com`.
