# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## Server

### Permission denied (publickey).
::: tip Error
Error: `Server is not reachable. Reason: root@host.docker.internal: Permission denied (publickey).`

:::

Your Coolify instance cannot reach the server it is running on. During installation, a public key is generated to `/data/coolify/ssh/keys/id.root@host.docker.internal.pub` and automatically added to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`.

If it is not added, you can add it manually by running the following command on your server:

```bash
  cat /data/coolify/ssh/keys/id.root@host.docker.internal.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

### Custom SSH Port
  If you would like to use a custom SSH port, you can set it in the `Server` tab of your server.

If you are self-hosting Coolify, you can simply set it after you installed Coolify on the `localhost` server.

### Increase Concurrent Builds
If you would like to increase the number of concurrent builds, you can set it in the `Server` tab of your server.

### Coolify Cloud Public IPs
If you need the public facing IPs to allow inbound connections to your servers, here is an up-to-date list of IPs that you can use to whitelist:
