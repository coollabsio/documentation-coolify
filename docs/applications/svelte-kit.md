# SvelteKit

Svelte Kit is a framework for building web applications of all sizes, with a beautiful development experience and flexible filesystem-based routing.

1. Set your site to static `on` (under `Build Pack` section).
2. Set your `Publish Directory` to `/build`

## Node server (`adapter-node`)

You need to use `@sveltejs/adapter-node` ([docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapter-node)) adapter to build a node server based SvelteKit app.

1. Set your site to static to `off` (under `Build Pack` section).
2. Set your `Start Command` to `node build`.
